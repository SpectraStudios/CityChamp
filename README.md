### 😎 Combining mixed reality gaming with onchain 3D scanning 🤳🏻🌐

City Champ is a mixed reality first-person combat, tower defense game developed for Meta Quest 3 using [Unity](https://unity.com/) and the [Solana SDK](https://github.com/magicblock-labs/Solana.Unity-SDK).

- As a player, defend your city 🏙️ from ghoulish creatures 👾 borne from urban social problems. Blast enemies, defend the *city core*, and collect reforms to win.
- As a scanner, scan the meshes for new play areas using your phone's built-in LiDAR scanner to add endless level location possibilities.
- (*coming soon!*) As a builder, design new levels using 3D scans from across your city to challenge your peers.

</br>

### 👨🏻‍💻 Roles 🦸🏻‍♀️

#### For players 🎮: (outdoor AR or indoor VR, headset)

1. Go to any location in your city (AR) or on the world map (VR) where a game level has been created.
2. Choose the level that you want and pay a small amount in CityChamp tokens to play.
3. Beat the level by collecting all the reforms that spawn in the play area, while blasting enemies and defending the *city core* from damage. Pick up stat boosts to help you in your battle.
4. Earn achievements and collectables for winning!

#### For scanners 📱: (outdoor, mobile)

1. Explore your local city to discover cool locations for AR content.
2. Scan the areas using a mobile scanning app, such as Polycam, Luma AI, or Scaniverse.
3. Send your scans to the MeshMap blockchain and earn tokens!
4. Earn achievements and collectables for scanning new areas!

#### (*coming soon!*) For builders 🛠️: (indoor VR, headset)

1. Choose any scanned area and pay a small amount in CityChamp tokens to use it for your game level.
2. Design the level by placing enemies, weapons, and stat boosts to spawn around the play area.
3. Submit your level and earn CityChamp tokens every time someone plays it!

### 🪙 How it works 🗺️

#### Sign up 🙋🏽‍♀️

- Download the CityChamp.apk build.
- Load it onto your Quest 2/3/Pro using [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto).
- Launch the app and create a new City Champ player account!
- Optional: Connect your Solana wallet or automatically generate a new wallet.*

*Connecting a wallet is needed to submit scans to MeshMap and receive collectables.

#### Gameplay loop 🔁

- The game is split into two play modes: Outdoor AR and Indoor VR.
- Go to any location in your city (AR) or on the world map (VR) where a game level has been created.
- Spend CityChamp tokens to play levels.
- Earn $MESH or CityChamp tokens for scanning and uploading mobile 3D scans of outdoor pedestrian-safe areas to the MeshMap blockchain. Scans and their original geotagged data are stored together.
- (*coming soon!*) Earn $MESH or CityChamp tokens when your scans are used by others.
- (*coming soon!*) Spend CityChamp tokens to use scans in your levels.
- (*coming soon!*) Earn CityChamp tokens when your levels are played.

#### Hand tracking 👉

Make sure hand tracking and passthrough are enabled in your Meta Quest settings.

### 🔗 Creating a decentralized 3D mesh of the world on blockchain 🌐

Our goal for City Champ—in addition to making urban AR as fun as possible—is to bootstrap an ambitious moonshot 🚀 product, **MeshMap**: a Solana DApp for scanning, geotagging, minting, and mapping a decentralized 3D mesh of the world.

![A digital rendering showing a city street through three lens of physical reality, AR, and VR.](https://github.com/SpectraStudios/.github/blob/main/spectra_3views.webp)

Mixed reality content creation is a wide open market. The 3D mapping industry is also primed for disruption.

With City Champ (and other games and experiences like it 👀) we can make scanning a decentralized 3D world map fun and rewarding 🎉. By integrating with MeshMap for scanning, AR games and creator platforms would function as a loosely connected network of spatial data sources and could facilitate an explosion in growth of AR content.

Furthermore, companies and governments could use MeshMap for large projects in urban planning, transportation, construction, disaster prevention and response, and other cases where spatial data is valuable.

Spatial data is too important to our collective future to let its collection and management be dominated by a handful of powerful tech companies. With MeshMap, we aim to design a decentralized alternative.
